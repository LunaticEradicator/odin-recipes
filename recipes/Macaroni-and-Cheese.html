    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Refrigerate leftover mac and cheese in an airtight container for three to four days. To reheat, stir in a splash
        of milk
        or cream and reheat in the microwave or on the stove, stirring periodically.

        You can freeze mac and cheese for up to six months. Allow the mac and cheese to cool completely, then transfer
        to a
        freezer-safe bag, removing as much air as possible. Label with the date and freeze. When you're ready to serve,
        simply
        transfer the dish to the fridge to thaw overnight. Reheat as normal.
