    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while
        this
        delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in your own kitchen. The main problem I
        have with
        most versions of Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much sauce and
        cheese that
        it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it doesn't have to be that way, not with this
        method.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Breading</li>
        <li>Frying</li>
        <li>Sauce-ing</li>
        <li>Cheese-ing</li>
        <li>Baking</li>
        <li>Panko — a Japanese breadcrumb found in any supermarket or grocery store, usually in Asian isles. Dryer than
            regular</li>
        <li>breadcrumbs, they absorb less oil producing a crispy and crunchier crumb! </li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs — Italian seasoned, golden or whatever you have on hand.</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese (or Provolone)</li>
        <li>Garlic (or onion) powder</li>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Pound chicken to an even thickness
            Pound the boneless chicken breasts out to an even width so they cook evenly. Basically, you're pounding the
            thick part
            down to the size of the thin part, about a half-inch thick.</li>

        <li>Don't skimp on seasoning
            Salt and pepper the chicken well. Then don't bother with salting the flour and bread crumbs.</li>

        <li>Add Parmesan to the bread crumbs
            Use Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little finely grated Parmesan cheese. When you fry the breaded chicken,
            the
            Parmesan
            will give it an extra crunch and exciting flavor.</li>

        <li>Rest before cooking
            Before frying, let the breaded chicken sit on the counter for about 15 minutes to allow the coating to
            adhere to
            the
            chicken breast.</li>

        <li>Go easy on the sauce
            THE KEY: Don't drown the poor breaded and fried chicken in sauce and smother it in cheese. Too much of a
            good
            thing is
            too much. You did all the work creating a crisp coating, why make it soggy with too much sauce and cheese?
        </li>

        <li>Make sure your oven is hot, hot, hot
            Be sure your oven is completely preheated to 450 F. You'll want the cheese to brown slightly and the
            breading to
            crisp
            up before the chicken gets overcooked, and a nice hot oven is the way to go.

            Now find out the best wine to pair with your non-soggy, not-too-saucy baked chicken Parmesan.</li>

    </ol>
